Feel free to use this as you wish. I can't support it!

You first need to install Node and NPM

For OSX (you need git installed btw)

	mkdir ~/local
	echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
	. ~/.bash_profile
	
	# could also fork, and then clone your own fork instead of the official one
	
	git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
	cd node
	./configure --prefix=~/local
	make install
	cd ..
	
	git clone git://github.com/isaacs/npm.git
	cd npm
	make install # or `make link` for bleeding edge
	

There are two parts for this to work

Once machine needs to connect to controller.html and then everyone else goes to view.html

You can move through the images with the left, right and space bar keys.

Images need to be stored in images/ and named sequentially from 0.jpg upwards. You could extend this to load in a JSON file with the file paths or use PHP to scan a directory for images and create an array.

You define the number of images in controller.html with adjusting :
	
	controller_object.total_items = 5,


Enjoy!
